-To weight a MC tree and recalculate the acc*Eff:
root -l FillHistoAndGetAccEffi.C+\(\"_input_shape\"\)
-The different y and pt input shapes are stored in InputShapeFile.root
-The input tree (containing MC events with reconstructed and generated information) should be in the directory GridAnalysis. For LHC17pq: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/PNyvSg1q5l25wZ1
